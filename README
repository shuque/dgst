# dgst: compute a cryptographic digest of input files or stdin,
# analogous to the "openssl dgst -md5|-sha1|-sha256|-sha512" command.
# Requires the "hashlib" module, in python >= 2.5
#
# Usage: dgst [md5|sha1|sha256|sha384|sha512] [file1 file2 ...]
#

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.5 or later

Installation:

    * System wide (typically /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), as root:

        python setup.py install

    * In your home directory ($HOME/bin):

        python setup.py install --home=$HOME

    * Or just copy the "dgst" file to wherever you want to put it.


Example runs:

$ echo hello | dgst sha256
sha256(STDIN)= 5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03

$ dgst md5 file1 file2 file3
md5(file1)= 2b1abc6b6c5c0018851f9f8e6475563b
md5(file2)= 575c5638d60271457e54ab7d07309502
md5(file3)= 3385b5d27d4c2923e9cde7ea53f28e2b
